  _________ Boeing 707-420 __________
	
	The first development of this Aircraft
	was from Innis Cunningham. This version
	is a revamp from this original. Nearly 
	everthing is written and painted new.
	Also the jsb. But ...
	It is more easier to write and paint 
	a model, if you have the old one to
	copy and past the "blueprints".
	Have fun wis Innis Cunningham revamps 707.
